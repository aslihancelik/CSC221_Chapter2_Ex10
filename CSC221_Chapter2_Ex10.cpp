// CSC221_Chapter2_Ex10.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. This is a program that calculates 
// the number of miles per gallon the car gets. The program first asks the user for the input of 
// number of gallons and the miles driven. Then the program calculates the miles per gallon with 
// the input. Lastly, program displays the result.
